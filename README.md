# Projects
[Ice Hockey Tournament](../blob/master/LICENSE)

In this project, I built a SuperTuxKart ice hockey agent based on supervised learning approach. In this game, our hocket agent plays against an AI agent with a game session of two minutes per round.  To win the game our agent have to score more goals than the opponent AI agent within two minutes. Explored two approaches: 1. Dagger based imitation learning; 2. Supervised learning approach based on vision and control. Final implementation was using the supervised learning approach because it gave better results compared to the Dagger method. I trained a deep network, with an average score 2-0 against the AI agent accorss different difficulty levels (Simple,Medium,Hard).
