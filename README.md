This portfolio is a compilation of all Data Science projects that I have done for academic and self learning.  

# Projects
 <#todo:Insert images for each project>
[Ice Hockey Tournament](../blob/master/LICENSE)

In this project, I built a SuperTuxKart ice hockey agent based on supervised learning approach. In this game, our hocket agent plays against an AI agent with a game session of two minutes per round.  To win the game our agent have to score more goals than the opponent AI agent within two minutes. Explored two approaches: 1. Dagger based imitation learning; 2. Supervised learning approach based on vision and control. Final implementation was using the supervised learning approach because it gave better results compared to the Dagger method. I trained a deep network, with an average score 2-0 against the AI agent accorss different difficulty levels (Simple,Medium,Hard).

[Self Driving Go-Kart Racer](../blob/master/LICENSE)

In this project, I built an agent which uses computer vision to drive a go-kart racer. I developed this game in the SuperTuxKart game environment.  The cart which is shown in the image uses ONLY the camera screen images as its input to predict its trajectory of motion.
